            <p>
                World large cities are expected to encourage diverse experience of citizens – to meet people 
                            with different social backgrounds. However, we have not yet able to test if the ongoing development 
                            in cities encourages such socially mixed experience. Here, we used the travel characteristics survey (TCS) 
                            data from Hong Kong across decades to estimate the changes of experienced social mixing from both place and 
                            individual perspectives.
